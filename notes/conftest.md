# conftest.py

In your tests, if you have some fixtures are needs to be used for multiple test files then you can keep those fixtures in conftest.py file. You donâ€™t need to import the fixture you want to use in a test, it automatically gets discovered by pytest. The discovery of fixture functions starts at test classes, then test modules, then conftest.py files and finally builtin and third party plugins.

Example:

conftest.py
```
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def initialize():
    print('initialize')
```

test_sample1.py
```
import pytest

def test_01():
    assert 2 == 2
```

test_sample2.py
```
import pytest

def test_02():
    assert 2 == 2
```

Run the above file,

```
pytest -s test_sample1.py test_sample2.py
```

```
